 *
 * Auxiliary information describes the type of each symbol.  The number
 * of AUX records required to describe a type depends upon the complexity
 * of that type.  The first record for a type is denoted by the index
 * field of a SYMR record.
 *
 * Types are composed of a basic type with zero or more type qualifiers.
 * A basic type is a core type supported by a language such as "integer",
 * "character", or "floating point".  Some basic types such as "structure"
 * or "set" can reference other types or other symbols.
 *
 * A type qualifier is a modifier for a type such as "pointer to", or
 * "array of".  If a type has more than one qualifier, they are ordered
 * from lowest to highest.  Lower qualifiers are applied to the basic
 * type before higher qualifiers.  To illustrate this, consider a
 * complex type such as "array of pointers to integers".  The basic type
 * for this is "integer" and there are two qualifiers, "array of" and
 * "pointer to".  Each element of the array is a "pointer to integer".
 * Therefore, the qualifier "pointer to" must be applied to the basic
 * type "integer" first.  In this example, the qualifier "pointer to" is
 * lower than the qualifier "array of".
 *
 * With this background, we can describe the structure of a type
 * description.  AUX records must be decoded by starting at the first
 * record for a type description and decoding each successive record in
 * the context of the previous records.  The following steps define an
 * algorithm for consuming AUX records and decoding a type description.
 * The numbered steps must be followed in order to consume the AUX
 * records correctly.
 *
 * 	1. If this type description is pointed at by a symbol with type
 * 	   stProc or stStaticProc, the first AUX is interpreted as an
 * 	   'isym'.  Its value is the index of the local symbol table entry
 * 	   that follows the procedure's stEnd symbol.
 *
 * 	2. The next AUX is always a TIR record.  This record contains
 * 	   the basic type and the first few type qualifiers.  If more
 * 	   type qualifiers are required, the TIR record has its
 * 	   'continued' field set.  The type qualifiers are numbered from
 * 	   0 to 5.  Qualifier 0 is the "lowest" (in the sense defined above).
 *
 * 	3. If the TIR record has its 'fBitfield' field set, the next
 * 	   AUX is interpreted as a 'width'.  The width is the size, in
 * 	   bits, of the type.
 *
 * 	4. The next AUX depends upon the basic type in the TIR record.
 * 	   If the next AUX is an RNDXR record, it may occupy either one
 * 	   or two AUX records.  See the RNDXR definition below for
 * 	   details.
 *
 * 		A) If the basic type is btStruct, btUnion, btEnum,
 * 		   btClass, or btTypedef; the next AUX is an RNDXR
 * 		   record.  The 'index' field of the RNDXR points into
 * 		   the local symbol table.  The specified local symbol is
 * 		   the start of the definition of the structure, union,
 * 		   enumeration, class or typedef.
 *
 * 		B) If the basic type is btSet, the next AUX is also an
 * 		   RNDXR.  The 'index' field of the RNDXR points into
 * 		   the AUX table.  The specified AUX record is the start
 * 		   of the description of the type of each element in the
 * 		   set.
 *
 * 		C) If the basic type is btIndirect, the next AUX is
 * 		   again an RNDXR whose 'index' field points into the
 * 		   AUX table.  The specified AUX record is the start of
 * 		   the description of the referenced type.
 *
 * 		D) If the basic type is btRange, the next three AUX
 * 		   records are used.  The next AUX is an RNDXR whose
 * 		   'index' field points into the AUX table.  The
 * 		   specified AUX is the start of the description of the
 * 		   type being subranged.  The AUX following the RNDXR is
 * 		   interpreted as a 'dnLow'.  This is the low bound of
 * 		   the range.  The final AUX is interpreted as a
 * 		   'dnHigh' and is the high bound of the range.
 *
 * 	5. The next AUX depends on the type qualifiers in the TIR record.
 * 	   Information for lower numbered type qualifiers is stored
 * 	   before information for higher numbered qualifiers.
 *
 * 		A) Each tqArray qualifier has four additional AUX
 * 		   records.  The first is an RNDXR whose index field
 * 		   points into the AUX table.  The AUX specified by this
 * 		   RNDXR is the type of the index into the array.  The
 * 		   AUX following the RNDXR is interpreted as a 'dnLow'.
 * 		   This is the low dimension of the array.  The next AUX
 * 		   is interpreted as a 'dnHigh' and is the high
 * 		   dimension.  The final AUX is interpreted as a
 * 		   'width'.  This is the size in bits of each element in
 * 		   the array.
 *
 * 	6. If the TIR record has its 'continued' field set, the next AUX
 * 	   is another TIR record.  Only the type qualifier and
 * 	   'continued' fields of this TIR are important.  The qualifiers
 * 	   in this TIR are all "higher" than the qualifiers in the previous
 * 	   TIR.  Additional AUX records are decoded as described in step 5.
 * 	   If this TIR has its 'continued' field set, repeat step 6.  The
 * 	   process stops when we reach a TIR with its 'continued' field
 * 	   cleared.
