  This this operation to disable all access to a disk device by the
  Logical Storage Manager.  This operation can be applied only to disks 
  that are not currently in a disk group.  Use this operation if you 
  intend to remove a disk from a system without rebooting.

  To re-enable access to the disk select "Enable (online) a disk device"
  from the disk operations menu.

  NOTE:  Many systems do not support disks that can be removed from
	 a system during normal operation.  On such systems, the
	 offline operation is seldom useful.
