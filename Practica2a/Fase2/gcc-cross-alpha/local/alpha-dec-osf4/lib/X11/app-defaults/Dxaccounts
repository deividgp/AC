! HISTORY
! 
! Name:
!	Dxaccounts - This file is the default application defaults 
!	file for the Digital UNIX Account Manager
!
! Description:
!	By default, the Account Manager will start with:
!	    - the Local Users view displayed. 
!	    - toolbar labels are enabled
!	    - pointer focus help messages are enabled. 
!	Also, each view can have specific display preferences. All views
!	default to:
!	    - Sort Order - Alpabetic
!	    - Direction  - Ascending
!	    - Display Icons - By Name and Icon
!	    - Display User Icons - By Username
!	Choosing Save Options from the Options menu will save
!	per-user preferences to the user's local app-defaults file
!	It is not recommended that any edits be performed on this file 
!	or the user's local app-defaults file. Instead, set the 
!	the desired settings in the user-interface and use Save Options. 
!	
!
! Include CDE default resources
#include "/usr/dt/app-defaults/C/Dt"
!
!
! The toolbar labels are in a smaller font than the rest of the 
! user interface.

! The following resources should be customized via the user interface
! and not by editing this file. Use the Save Options item on the Options

!	- the settings in the View Preferences dialog
!	- the settings of the Options menu toggle buttons (

!	  shared by dxaccounts and the account management 
!	  command line interface (the useradd, usermod, groupadd, groupmod,
!	  etc. commands). These shared preferences are saved
!	  in $HOME/.sysman/Account_defaults and not in this resource file.
