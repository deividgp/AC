#	given:	global variable $_FILE
#	does:	The Replace_It routine is used to simply replace the
#		configuration file with the new version.  It moves the
#		old file out of the way to save user customizations.
#		These customizations will have to be added by hand by
#		the user after the update.
#	note:	This is called twice:  once in the "ToProto" phase with
#		_FILE=.proto..<fn>, and again in the "ToConfig" phase
#		with _FILE=<fn>.
