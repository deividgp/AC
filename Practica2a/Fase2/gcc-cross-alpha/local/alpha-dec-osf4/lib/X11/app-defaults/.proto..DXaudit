!
! This resource changes the list of events loaded into all list boxes
! with the "Base/Site Events" heading.  Setting the value to True
! will use only security relevant audit events (the set found in
! /var/tcb/audit/base_events).  Setting the value
! to False will make dxaudit use all events on the system.  This includes
! all system calls, no-sys events, etc.  It will slightly impact
! performance on screen mapping of those screens containing the event
! list boxes.  It is recommended that security relevant events be used.
!
! NB: If during execution, dxaudit queries an event mask which contains
!     an unrecognized event, it will query the user to switch into 
!     full event mode if not already in that mode.
!
*auditUseSecEvents:	True

!
! This resource changes the display of the Active Process List from
! dxaudit->Collection->Modify Active Process Mask.  See the ps(1) reference
! page for all the details.
!
!
*auditPsOptions:	ppid,args

!
! This resource changes the sorted order of the ps(1) output in 
! dxaudit->Collection->Modify Active Process Mask.
!
! Valid options are:
!
!	 ps    for ps(1) native order
!	 name  for alphabetic ordering by user name
!
!
*auditPsSortOrder:	name

!
! The following resource tells dxaudit how many 256K chunks of memory
! it can allocate when receiving audit report data from audit_tool.  When
! the length of the report exceeds this amount of memory, the oldest
! 256K chunk of data is discarded as long as the user is not viewing it
! at the moment.  This discarded chunk cannot be accessed again unless
! the report is re-generated.
!
*auditMaxReportSections:	20

!
! This resource pertains to the storage of audit report data in the
! 256K chunks mentioned above.  When "Brief Record" format is selected,
! dxaudit actually stores both full and brief records so that it can
! blow up an brief record into a full record.  Both formats are stored
! within the 256K chunk, but they are segregated.  This resource 
! specifies the start of the full record bucket.  As a report is
! generating, dxaudit adjusts this split for future chunks according
! to how efficiently the memory is being used.  This resource represents
! a starting value for each time a report is generated.
!
! This is commented out because the code sets a good value on its own
! which is different between MLS+ and vanilla OSF/1
!
!*auditRecordSplit:	49152


! The following resource (mostly) corrects a pathological problem with the
! audit report scale widget.  When the load of the text widget takes longer
! than the initialDelay of the scale widget, it repeatedly acts as if the
! scale were being moved.  This can cause loss of audit report data.  This
! only occurs when lots of data is stacked up from the audit_tool.
!
*XmScale*initialDelay:  1250
